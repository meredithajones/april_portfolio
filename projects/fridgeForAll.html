              Fridge for all was created to help manage the inventory of
              Philadelphia's community fridges. Over the course of the pandemic,
              roughly 25 community fridges and free food pantries have sprung up
              to help address food insecurity in the city.
              My group of collaborators and I created this project as a prototype 
              to help manange the inventory of each community fridge. 
              The application allows each user to create an account, and on the main page,
              to add and subtract quantities from existing fridge inventory, as well 
              as to input entierly new items into the inventory along with a count of how 
              many they are putting in.

                <p>I took on the back end work for this project. 
                    I created all of the routes for both the front and back end,
                    and conducted vigorous testing with postman to make sure that they
                    were functioning properly.
                    We began with an initial list of food inventory in the 
                    fridge for demonstation purposes.

                    My partner Luke handled authentication, as well as 
                    setting up the Mapquest API.

                    Kara Schmidt designed the logo and was in charge of the color scheme, 
                    and all aspects of the front end 
                    design and planning the elements of the user experience.
